## Building the project

### Local build

1. [Clone and install](#installation) this repo
2. Produce a production build using `npm`

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Production build

It is not necessary to build for production manually. A CI/CD pipeline has been set up for automatic deployment when pushing changes and/or features to the `main` branch.

For more info, check out the [deployment docs](/documentation/deployment.md).

## Development

### Trunk based development

> Trunk based development: a source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.

Instead of the traditional git-flow, this project is based on the [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) principle.
